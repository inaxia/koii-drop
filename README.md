# KOII DROP
> Hackathon: Hack the Network

## How does KOII DROP work?
1. It Take some required files like csv, fs, etc, Koii-sdk and some wallet paths.
2. It creates tools to be used for transfering Koii.
3. It takes CSV file's path in a variable.
4. It reads the CSV file and takes Name & Wallet Address from that.
5. It adds all the Wallet Addresses to a new list
6. It reads a Wallet from which the Koii would be transferred to others
7. At last, KOII DROP is transferring 0.05 Koii to each to those Wallet adresses present in that list.

## To Sum Up, KOII DROP is:
1. Reading the CSV file
2. Storing all the Wallet Addresses and reading a Wallet from which Koii would be transferred
3. Transfering Koii to the Wallet Addresses present
